Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
Round Robin because 123412341234 keeps printing

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)

Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Process 1:1280-3 milliseconds
Process 2:1280-2 milliseconds

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
Process 1:320 milliseconds
Process 2:320(2) milliseconds
Process 3:320(3) milliseconds
Process 4:320(4) milliseconds

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Process 1:0 milliseconds
Process 2:1 milliseconds
Process 3:2 milliseconds
Process 4:3 milliseconds

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
Process 1:0 milliseconds
Process 2:320 milliseconds
Process 3:640 milliseconds
Process 4:960 milliseconds

Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A or Exercise 4B?
Exercise 4A

Exercise 5:
Process 4 because it is the first number missing in the output

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:
Tried to do the extra credit problems, 4b, 7, but couldn't. They should not interfere with compiling the other exercises though.
