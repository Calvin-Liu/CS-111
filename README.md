Operating Systems. Lab 1 was to implement a shell like interface and optimize it using system calls.
Unfortunately, me and my partner Johnathan Ong, were not able tp successfully optimize the tree that we created since we didn't know we had to change a certain
file since that file never had a 'Fix me' comment or we were told that we can
change that file.

Lab 4 was hard to test since the server was crashing a lot due to the amount of UCLA students using the servers.
